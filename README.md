# Housing Reallocation via Network Analysis
A housing authority manages public housing. The needs of the families that live in the public housing change over time. As a family grows, they may want more bedrooms or garage space. At the same time, as children grow up and move out, a family may need less bedrooms. Yet, other families may just want to move to a different part of the city to be closer to work. To account for these adjustments, the housing authority wants to develop a system to efficiently reassign the housing units so that as many of these families get re-assigned to their preferred unit type. 

This project implements the algorithm described in J.W. Wright's 1975 paper: *Reallocation of Housing by Use of Network Analysis*. It identifies optimal reallocation cycles for housing units based on tenant preferences using network flow techniques.

## Features
- Constructs a directed graph of tenant move requests
- Applies Floyd-Warshall to identify shortest cycles
- Extracts valid exchange circuits with bottleneck demand
- Updates allocation matrix after each cycle
