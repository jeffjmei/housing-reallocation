# Housing Reallocation via Network Analysis

This project implements the algorithm described in J.W. Wright's 1975 paper, *Reallocation of Housing by Use of Network Analysis*. It identifies optimal reallocation cycles for housing units based on tenant preferences using network flow techniques.

## Features
- Constructs a directed graph of tenant move requests
- Applies Floyd-Warshall to identify shortest cycles
- Extracts valid exchange circuits with bottleneck demand
- Updates allocation matrix after each cycle
